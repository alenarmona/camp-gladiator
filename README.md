## Description

I've used the create-react-app project because I don't have much experience in React.
It's taken me around 12 hours of development (not counting some quick courses I've made).
Off course, there are many improvements to apply, but I've tried to find a balance between speed, features, and look & feel.
I've added a Skeleton skin and simulated an API call (with setTimeout) in the workouts list.
Also, I've created some basic render tests.
Please, give me some feedback about the challenge.

## Setup project

1. Clone repo in your machine
2. In the project director, execute: `npm install`

## Run project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
